# electrodynamic_dust_shield_simulation
This electrodynamic dust shield (EDS) simulation is to prove the efficacy of an aromatic thermosetting copolyester and polytetrafluroethylene (ATSP/PTFE) composite embedded in a matrix of multi-wall carbon nanotubes for lunar dust mitigation. This simulation leverages the boundary element method (BEM) to solve for the electric field gradient.
