# Electrodynamic Dust Shielding On Lunar EVA Spacesuits: A Composite Electrode of ATSP, MWCNT, and PTFE via Spray Deposition
This electrodynamic dust shield (EDS) simulation is to prove the efficacy of an aromatic thermosetting copolyester and polytetrafluroethylene (ATSP/PTFE) composite embedded in a matrix of multi-wall carbon nanotubes for lunar dust mitigation. This simulation leverages the boundary element method (BEM) to solve for the electric field gradient. Over a time period of one second, the position, velocity, and acceleration of a lunar dust particle with a radius of 50 microns is found in time steps of 0.01 seconds. Position, velocity, and acceleration time graphs are generated from this.
